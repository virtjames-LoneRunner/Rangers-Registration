<h3>This is just a very simple Registration and Login program.</h3>
I'm was yet to learn about using databases with Python at this point, so I just made this using a .txt file as my credentials storage.
Would like to see what you would change to it.

<h3>Usage</h3>
Just use the main.py file.
There are further instructions in the program.
